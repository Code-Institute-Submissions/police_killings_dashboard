### Live link : https://declanmunroe.github.io/stream_one_project/

#### Built with :

* Flask
* Python
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap3
* MongoDB Database
* JavaScript Libraries
  * d3.js
  * dc.js
  * crossfilter.js
  * queue.js
* A dataset in the format of a .csv file

#### Components :

##### Flask

A Python micro-framework that was used to serve the data and render the HTML pages for this Application.

##### Python

A Python file name threatened_species.py renders a graphs.html template and builds a web server using pymongo to interact with MongoDB.

##### MongoDB Database

NoSQL database that converts and presents data in JSON format. The dataset resource was downloaded as a csv file. It had many different rows of data, some rows that were not needed, so I developed a little Python script to clean the data and create a new .csv file that only contains the rows of data that I wanted to present with the graphs.
